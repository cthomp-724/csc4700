What is your favorite movie?
My favorite movie is The Goonies.
If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?
I'd probably either go to Tokyo, Japan or Seoul, South Korea. I'm a huge gaming nerd and those places are huge for gaming, also I want to just experience those place's culture.
If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?
I'd honestly prefer to have teleportation. Being able to travel either short distances or long distances in an instant would make my life so much easier. I'd save a lot of money from not having to pay for public transportation or gas when I eventually get my license and a car.
